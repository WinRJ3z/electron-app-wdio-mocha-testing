4. Click the record button
5. Do one of the following two things:
    1. If you want to record the full screen, click anywhere. *Note: The video will start recording immediately after you click*
    2. If you only want to record part of the screen, drag a box around the area you want to record. *Note: You will need to click "Start Recording" after dragging the box to start recording*
6. When you're done recording, click the stop button in your computer's menu bar
