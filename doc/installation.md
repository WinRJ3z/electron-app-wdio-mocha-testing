When the .dmg file is finished downloading, double click on it. When a window pops up, drag the app into the
"Applications" folder.

Once the app is finished copying, you need to grant it permission to run the first time. To do so, open Finder and go
into your Applications. Right click on "MOVtoMP4" and click "Open".
